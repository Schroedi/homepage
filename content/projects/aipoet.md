## Generating poems with GPT4

I conducted an experiment to test OpenAI's GPT in generating poems. While GTP3.5 could create poems in English, its German creations were not as impressive. However, the latest version, GPT 4, shows potential to generate German poems. I created a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) application with the [Skeleton](skeleton.dev/) UI toolkit to showcase this. You can find a live version of this application [here](https://poems-peach.vercel.app). The prompt language and the browser language determine the language of the output.
