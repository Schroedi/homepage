    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated November 30, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Notice for Schröder EDV Dienste ("<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>"), describes how and why we might access, collect, store, use, and/or share ("<strong>process</strong>") your personal information when you use our services ("<strong>Services</strong>"), including when you:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Download and use our mobile application (Planetary Wars), or any other application of ours that links to this Privacy Notice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>

    <h3>Personal information you disclose to us</h3>
    <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.</p>
    <p><strong>Sensitive Information.</strong> We do not process sensitive information.</p>

    <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>
    <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>

    <p>The information we collect includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Log and Usage Data.</strong> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).</li>
        <li><strong>Device Data.</strong> We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data.</strong> We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Google API</h3>
    <p>Our use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>

    <h2>2. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.
    </div>

    <p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
        <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
    <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
    <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
        <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
        <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
        <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
        <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
        <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
        <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
        <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
        <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
        <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
        <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
        <li>We may disclose de-identified information for approved research or statistics projects, subject to ethics oversight and confidentiality commitments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.
    </div>

    <p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
        <li><strong>Offer Wall.</strong> Our application(s) may display a third-party hosted "offer wall." Such an offer wall allows third-party advertisers to offer virtual currency, gifts, or other items to users in return for the acceptance and completion of an advertisement offer. Such an offer wall may appear in our application(s) and be displayed to you based on certain data, such as your geographic area or demographic information. When you click on an offer wall, you will be brought to an external website belonging to other persons and will leave our application(s). A unique identifier, such as your user ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider in order to prevent fraud and properly credit your account with the relevant reward.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</h2>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third parties that we may link to or who advertise on our Services, but are not affiliated with, our Services.
    </div>

    <p>The Services, including our offer wall, may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third-party websites. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this Privacy Notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.</p>

    <h2>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.
    </div>

    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

    <h2>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
    </div>

    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

    <h2>7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction.
    </div>

    <p>We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@keks.dev">info@keks.dev</a>.</p>

In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
