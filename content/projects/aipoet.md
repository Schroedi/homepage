## Generating poems with GPT4
This is an experiment to see how good OpenAI's GPT is at generating poems. While GTP3.5 is already able to generate poems in English, it's German works where underwhelming. The new GPT 4 is also able to generate German poems. Here is a small application built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) using the [Skeleton](skeleton.dev/) UI toolkit.

A live version can be found [here](https://poems-peach.vercel.app). The output language depends on the current browser language and prompt language.
