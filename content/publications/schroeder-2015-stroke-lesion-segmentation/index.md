abstract: Motivation Ischemic stroke, triggered by an obstruction in the cerebral
  blood supply, leads to infarction of the affected brain tissue. An accurate and
  reproducible automatic segmentation is of high interest, since the lesion volume
  is an important end-point for clinical trials. However, various factors, such as
  the high variance in lesion shape, location and appearance, render it a difficult
  task.   Methods In this article, nine classification methods (e.g. Generalized Linear
  Models, Random Decision Forests and Convolutional Neural Networks) are evaluated
  and compared with each other using 37 multiparametric MRI datasets of ischemic stroke
  patients in the sub-acute phase in terms of their accuracy and reliability for ischemic
  stroke lesion segmentation. Within this context, a multi-spectral classification
  approach is compared against mono-spectral classification performance using only
  FLAIR MRI datasets and two sets of expert segmentations are used for inter-observer
  agreement evaluation.   Results and Conclusion The results of this study reveal
  that high-level machine learning methods lead to significantly better segmentation
  results compared to the rather simple classification methods, pointing towards a
  difficult non-linear problem. The overall best segmentation results were achieved
  by a Random Decision Forest and a Convolutional Neural Networks classification approach,
  even outperforming all previously published results. However, none of the methods
  tested in this work are capable of achieving results in the range of the human observer
  agreement and the automatic ischemic stroke lesion segmentation remains a complicated
  problem that needs to be explored in more detail to improve the segmentation results.
