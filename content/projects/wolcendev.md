## A character planner for Wolcen

[Wolcen.dev](https://Wolcen.dev) is a character planner for the action RPG [Wolcen Lords of Mayhem](https://wolcengame.com/).

The project is built using the [Godot](godotengine.org/) game engine for several reasons. First, when I started the project in 2020, it had been over ten years since I programmed a web application. On the other hand, I had used Godot quite a bit. I knew that Godot would be able to handle the smooth drawing of all the nodes.

Working with Godot is really fun and refreshing because of the fast iteration speed and easy deployment. The downside is that the app is big - though not nearly as big as an Unreal or Unity app, not suited for small screens like phones and lacks accessibility features.

The data is automatically extracted from the game files, but requires some manual cleaning after large patches.
